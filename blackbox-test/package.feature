    Then it should succeed with "Successfully built "

  Scenario: with a failing package service
    Given a file named "docker-compose.yml" with:
    """yaml
    package:
      image: busybox
      command: /bin/false
    """
    And a file named "lc.yml" with:

  Scenario: with a docker artifact and configured image name via lc.yml
    Given a file named "docker-compose.yml" with:
    """yaml
