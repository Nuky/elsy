Feature: system upgrade task
  Scenario: try to upgrade snapshot build
      If this is a non-release build, the test binary will have "snapshot" in the name, and the upgrade
      will fail because we don't upgrade snapshots. If it's a release build, it will fail because the
      current version is the same as the upgrade version.
    When I run `lc --debug system upgrade`
    Then the output should contain one of the following:
        | Upgrade not available on snapshot versions |
        | No new version available |

  Scenario: upgrade a non-snapshot build
    Given I run `mkdir -p /opt/bin`
    And I run `cp /opt/project/target/lc-blackbox /opt/bin/lc-test`
    And I run `chmod 755 /opt/bin/lc-test && ln -s /opt/bin/lc-test /opt/bin/lc`
    And I run `/opt/project/blackbox-test/bin/patch-strings-in-binary /opt/bin/lc-test "$(/opt/bin/lc --version|awk '{print $3}')" "v1.9.9"`
    When I run `/opt/bin/lc --debug system upgrade`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain all of these:
        | Upgrading to |
        | Done!        |
        | 100.00%      |
    When I run `/opt/bin/lc --version`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should not contain "test"
    Then I run `rm -rf /opt/bin`

  Scenario: try to upgrade same version
    Given I run `mkdir -p /opt/bin`
    And I run `cp /opt/project/target/lc-blackbox /opt/bin/lc-test`
    And I run `chmod 755 /opt/bin/lc-test && ln -s /opt/bin/lc-test /opt/bin/lc`
    And I run `/opt/project/blackbox-test/bin/patch-strings-in-binary /opt/bin/lc-test "$(/opt/bin/lc --version|awk '{print $3}')" $(curl https://api.github.com/repos/cisco/elsy/releases/latest 2>/dev/null|grep tag_name|awk '{print $2}'|sed "s/\"\|,//g")`
    When I run `/opt/bin/lc --debug system upgrade`
    Then it should succeed
    And the output should contain "No new version available"
