Feature: publish task

  Scenario: with an empty project, calling publish without the git branch
    When I run `lc publish`

    Given a file named "docker-compose.yml" with:
    """yaml
    publish:
      image: busybox
      command: echo foo
    """
    When I run `lc publish --git-branch origin/master`
    Then it should succeed with "foo"

  Scenario: with a publish service, calling publish on a release branch
    Given a file named "docker-compose.yml" with:
    """yaml
    publish:
      image: busybox
      command: echo foo

    When I run `lc publish --git-branch origin/release/1.5`

    And I run `lc publish --git-branch=origin/master`
